This repository provides a centralized, community-driven database of Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) that are included or excluded from cashback, rewards, or bonus categories across Indian credit and debit cards.
All MCC definitions are stored in a unified `mcc_definitions.json`, while bank-wise and card-wise folders list MCCs allowed or excluded for each card in simple, lightweight JSON files.
